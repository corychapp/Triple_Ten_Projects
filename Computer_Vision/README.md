# GoodSeed Supermarket - Age Verification using Computer Vision with TensorFlow

## Introduction
This project aims to assist the GoodSeed Supermarket chain in exploring the application of Data Science to ensure compliance with alcohol laws. The primary objective is to leverage Computer Vision to prevent the sale of alcohol to individuals who are underage.

## Initialization
### Details of Computer Vision Project
The project began with a concise Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) accompanied by visualizations. TensorFlow and Keras served as the core frameworks for implementation. The ImageDataGenerator was employed to establish a streamlined process, and a loop was created to organize image batches. The model utilized ReLu activation, Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the loss function, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for accuracy metrics. Functions were developed to load and execute the models effectively.

## The Data
The dataset for this project comprises images of faces, serving as the foundation for the regression task focused on predicting a person's age.

## Results
In this regression task, the model trained on facial images demonstrated the capability to accurately predict a person's age. This technology holds the potential to provide precise predictions, contributing to the supermarket's efforts in adhering to age-related alcohol regulations.
