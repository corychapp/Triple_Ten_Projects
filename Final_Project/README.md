# Interconnect - Churn Forecasting Project

## Introduction
This collaborative project, led by a team leader, addresses the business goal of Interconnect, a telecom operator. The primary objective is to forecast customer churn, identifying clients likely to discontinue services. This proactive forecasting allows Interconnect to preemptively offer loyalty perks, such as special plan options and promotional codes, to retain customer loyalty.

## Details of Forecasting Project
The project was divided into distinct phases, commencing with data preprocessing to ensure optimal cleanliness and subsequently generating a data analysis report containing valuable insights for actionable business outcomes. Further tasks involved computing data for machine learning, encompassing data encoding and preparation for numerical analysis. The correct framework was employed to determine categorical outcomes essential for achieving the project's mission. Visualization techniques were utilized for reporting, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model accuracy.

## Team Collaboration
- **Team Lead:** Assigned tasks and monitored model progress to meet requirements and ensure timely deployment.
- **Quality Assurance:** An independent expert from the QA department specializing in machine learning. Reviewed code to guarantee its quality and readiness for deployment.

## The Data
The dataset used is a modified version sourced from Kaggle.

## Results
During the exploratory data analysis (EDA), it was discovered that the data exhibited imbalance. To address this, the data was balanced using a scaler with pipelines. Predictive models were constructed, incorporating accuracy tests. The final binary classification model passed the accuracy tests and was visually validated using the AUC-ROC plot, solidifying its efficacy in predictive forecasting.
