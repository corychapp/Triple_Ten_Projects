# Ice - Integrated Project 1: Statistical Analysis and Forecasting

## Introduction
This integrated project focuses on the statistical analysis and forecasting for Ice, an online video game distributor with a global presence. The objective is to derive valuable insights for game production and sales expectations, identifying patterns that contribute to a game's success. The analysis serves to pinpoint potential blockbuster games and provide guidance to the marketing team for strategic advertising campaigns, with a specific emphasis on forecasting 2017 sales.

### Details of Statistical Analysis and Forecasting
The project commenced with data cleaning and preprocessing, involving the calculation of total sales across all regions and the creation of a new feature-engineered column. A histogram was generated to visualize the distribution of games over the years. Additionally, region-specific seller profiles were developed to highlight the best-selling genres in each region.

#### The Data
Utilizing historical game data spanning from 1980 to 2016, the project aims to inform the upcoming 2017 game launch.

### Results
Key observations include the varying sales performance across different gaming platforms, with PS2 leading, followed by X360 and PS3. The analysis provides insights into the distribution of the top 10 platforms and their sales trends over the years, showcasing PS2's sustained high sales. Platforms tend to lose popularity approximately 7.5 years after their initial release. Action and shooter genres emerge as the highest-selling categories. The analysis leads to the conclusion of not rejecting the Null Hypothesis for the average user ratings of Xbox One and PC platforms being the same. Conversely, the Null Hypothesis is rejected for the average user ratings of Action and Sports genres being different.
