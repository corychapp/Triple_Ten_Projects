# Sure Tomorrow Insurance - Linear Algebra for Data Obfuscation

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for the benefit of Sure Tomorrow Insurance. The objective is to establish goals and target areas that provide insights into customer behavior. The approach involves grouping similar clients for targeted marketing efforts, building models to predict the likelihood and quantity of claims for new clients, aiding in profitability assessments, setting quotas, and ensuring the privacy of client data to prevent privacy breaches.

### Details of Linear Algebra
Following data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the identification of similar clients is achieved using distance vectors, specifically Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance, to determine optimal results. Both scaled and unscaled data are considered, with observations noted. A data transformation algorithm is developed to enhance data obfuscation, making it challenging to recover personal information if the data were to fall into the wrong hands. This is accomplished through the use of a multiplied matrix of the data.

## The Data
The data used for this project was provided by the company, Sure Tomorrow Insurance.

## Results
Automation of machine learning facilitates the discovery of similarities among customers. Predictions regarding which customers may file claims can be made with a reasonable level of accuracy. The implementation of data obfuscation techniques ensures the protection of customer data and the integrity of the company's brand.
