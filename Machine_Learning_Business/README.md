# Oily Giant - Machine Learning for Automation of New Business Locations

## Introduction
Working for the Oily Giant mining company, this project focuses on finding the optimal location for a new oil well. The goal is to collect parameters such as oil quality and volume of reserves in the selected region, and build a predictive model to estimate the volume of reserves in new wells. This model aids in determining predictability for maximizing profit growth through strategically placing new wells.

### Details of Automation of New Business Locations
Following data cleaning and analysis, a function was developed to calculate profits from the best 200 wells. Additionally, risks associated with each region were calculated, and a function was created to generate expected profit losses for further estimations. Bootstrapping was employed to generate a vector representing potential profits based on smaller random subsets.

## The Data
The data used for this project was derived from the historical efforts of the company, Oily Giant.

## Results
The analysis revealed a normal distribution, instilling confidence in the success of building in specific areas for consistent profits. Profit calculations indicate a safe investment estimate, with a barrel count of $111.11 per thousand barrels of oil. Two regions emerged as closely matched in all metrics, making the function's profit calculations based on our prediction model a valuable tool. The recommendation is to commence drilling the first 200 wells in region II for optimal profitability.
